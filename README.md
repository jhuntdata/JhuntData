## Hi, I’m James 👋

I’m a UK-based **Data Engineer** working on production data platforms and pipelines.

My work focuses on:
- Lakehouse-style data architectures
- PySpark-based ETL and incremental ingestion
- SQL data modelling and analytics layers
- API-driven data ingestion and automation
- Data quality, reconciliation, and reliability

Most of the projects here are inspired by real production problems and have been anonymised. The emphasis is on **patterns, structure, and decision-making**, not toy examples.
